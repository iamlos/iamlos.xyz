  p To show how effective one page sites can be, we created a site to market the service. In addition to covering the basics, the site features social media links, a contact form to allow visitors to easily begin a project and a mailing list sign-up so that they can begin receiving regular emails with tips on how to make their next site a success. Within the first day of launching the product, we have already acquired new projects for single page sites.

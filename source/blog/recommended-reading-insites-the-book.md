Over this past weekend, I finally got around to reading *<a href="http://viewportindustries.com/insites-the-book" target="_blank">Insites: The Book</a>* by <a href="http://keirwhitaker.com" target="_blank">Keir Whitaker</a> & <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com" target="_blank">Elliot Jay Stocks</a>. This wonderfully well written book features personal interviews with leading designers that are helping the shape the web today. Designers, that we regularly find ourselves inspired by. It is a reminder of how honored we are to be part of the thoughtful, hardworking and passionate community that gets to make things for the web.

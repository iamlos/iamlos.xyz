Prior to starting any new project with a client, it's typical to ask a lot of questions. Often, these inquiries help us get a good idea of what the client's business and values are like. Additionally, it helps us to determine the technologies, features and scope involved with the project. However, there is one question that ends up being most important -- "What does success look like?"

Ultimately, our goal is not to simply deliver logos, websites or web applications. We want to help our clients achieve what they desire for their business. In order to do this, we want to find out what these goals are. From start to finish, having the client's needs in mind will help us to create a process that delivers a viable solution that makes everyone happy. Additionally, there are always ways to exceed the goals. Businesses need much more than just a website. Rather, they are hoping to increase traffic, communicate to their audience efficiently, retain visitors longer and most importantly -- create conversions and increase sales. In the same way, a business doesn't just need a logo. A business should be memorable, look professional and have an identity system that communicates value. A web application should save a business time, alleviate difficulties and make routine tasks easier.

Before you begin your next project with a designer or developer, take the time to explore what your goals are. What will determine its success or failure in three months, six months or a year? What will be the value gained through additional revenue or time saved? Those that are worth hiring are not in the business of just making things, they are in the business of making things better. What does success look like for your next project?
